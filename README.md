# Data Science Notebooks

Welcome to the Data Science Notebooks repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that cover a wide range of topics in data science, including machine learning, data visualization, natural language processing, and more. The notebooks are organized into different folders based on their use cases, techniques, approaches, models, and more.

This is a continuously growing repository, and new notebooks will be added over time. The notebooks in this repository are meant to be educational resources and can be used as a reference for learning and practicing data science.

## Usage

To use the notebooks in this repository, you can clone the repository to your local machine and run the notebooks in your Jupyter environment. Each notebook is self-contained and can be run independently.

## Contents

The notebooks in this repository cover a wide range of topics in data science, including:

- Machine learning models (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.)
- Data visualization (e.g. matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, etc.)
- Natural language processing (e.g. text classification, sentiment analysis, etc.)
- Data preprocessing (e.g. data cleaning, feature scaling, feature engineering, etc.)
- Time series analysis (e.g. ARIMA models, Prophet, etc.)

The notebooks are organized into different folders based on their use cases, techniques, approaches, models, and more. Here are some examples of the folders in this repository:

- `classification`: Contains notebooks that cover different classification models and techniques.
- `regression`: Contains notebooks that cover different regression models and techniques.
- `visualization`: Contains notebooks that cover different data visualization libraries and techniques.
- `nlp`: Contains notebooks that cover different natural language processing techniques and models.
- `preprocessing`: Contains notebooks that cover different data preprocessing techniques and approaches.
- `timeseries`: Contains notebooks that cover different time series analysis models and techniques.
